                    selka started as a CREST project, but it quickly became something much bigger. our goal was simple: create an app that designs personalized workouts using AI. but we didn’t stop there. we refined it, expanded its capabilities, and made it better every day to ensure that users get the most effective and engaging fitness experience possible.
